💰 FinVerse – AI-Powered Finance Awareness & Demo Investment Platform

Learn. Practice. Grow.
Where financial wisdom meets real-world experience.

🧩 Overview

FinVerse is an interactive, AI-driven financial learning platform designed to help users understand, practice, and master personal finance and investment concepts — without real risk.
It combines education, simulation, and behavioral analytics into a single ecosystem that promotes financial literacy through experience.

Users can explore multiple financial domains like stocks, cryptocurrency, gold, and mutual funds, each with a dedicated demo wallet and real-time data integration.
Through guided lessons, practice investments, and an AI mentor, users learn not just how to invest — but how to think like responsible investors.

🎯 Problem Statement

Financial literacy among young adults and beginners is still very low.
Most learning platforms focus on theory and ignore the psychological and practical aspects of finance.
Simulators often use unlimited virtual money, creating unrealistic trading behavior and removing emotional responsibility from decisions.

FinVerse solves this by providing an engaging, limited, and realistic simulation environment paired with structured learning and AI guidance.

💡 Solution

FinVerse bridges the gap between learning and real-world practice through:

🎓 Structured Learning: Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced modules with visual tools like flashcards, mindmaps, and quizzes.

💸 Demo Investment Simulator: Practice investing with demo credits for each asset type using live market data (Crypto, Stocks, Gold, Mutual Funds).

🧠 AI Mentor: Explains mistakes, answers financial queries, and suggests personalized lessons.

🏅 Honor Score System: Tracks behavior, learning consistency, and risk discipline to promote responsible investing habits.

📊 Portfolio Dashboard: Displays live P&L, diversification, and behavior analytics with real-time charts.
